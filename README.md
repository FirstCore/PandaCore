PandaCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++, 
World of Warcraft game server emulator. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from Trinity, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the
code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve
and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit
